# IEM 3703 (Fall 2024) Projects

------------------------
**Team #1**
- Subject: Kicker Audio Quality Control Test
- Client: *Kicker*
- Project Description: Originally, our problem statement involved examining the torque variance
on the machine that screws the metal posts into the plastic grill plates. We investigated the hypothesis that a low
tensile strength in the plastic grill in certain products (caused by a high variance in the
tensile strength) is compounding the issue and causing the plates to be defective.

**Team #2**
- Subject: Associations between Machining Metrics and Student Precision
- Client: *OSU machining Lab*
- Project Description: We are examining the relationship between student precision in machining components
and a number of confounding variables, the particular machine being used, and the person
providing supervision. By determining these variables, we want to comprehend how they affect
student performance and machining quality. This entails giving careful thought to the
surroundings, equipment, and supervision factors that could affect how well students do
machining jobs.

**Team #3**
- Subject: Predicting Cafe Libro's Sales Averages for different sales items
- Client: *Cafe Libro*
- Project Description: Our goal is to find the sales trends of Cafe Libro, a prominent place on
campus where students can buy food while in the heart of campus.

**Team #4**
- Subject: Optimizing 3D Printing Processes for Enhanced Performance
- Client: *Dr. Ramesh's Lab*
- Project Description: Our project goal is to analyze how line width changes with respect to changes in sheath gas, volumetric flow rate of the carrier gas (MC), and speed in a 3D printing process for a 150 micron nozzle of aerosol jet printing.

------------------------

**Team #5**
- Subject: Statistical Analysis of Patient Arrival Times in a Dermatology Clinic
- Client: *Dermatology Clinic*
- Project Description: In this study, we focus on a dermatology clinic that has reported varying levels of punctuality throughout the day. Some time periods see higher rates of late arrivals, which raises the question: are these variations purely random, or do specific factors, such as the time of day, play a role?
------------------------

**Team #6**
- Subject: Revenue Dynamics of Signal Security: A Data-Driven Exploration
- Client: *Signal Security*
- Project Description: This study analyzes and examines revenue trends for Signal Security, a local security
company based out of Oklahoma City, through analyzing historical data from October 2023 to
October 2024.
